# Pytho{\\}

I hate the fact that i need to tab "properly" python files, that may cause several errors and confusions betweens actual tabs and spaces. 
Why not just use regular curly brackets? 
So I created `Pytho{\}` a simple python pre-compiler with no pip dependencies, that simplily parses the python with curly brackets into the normal sintax and runs it, after the execution the temporary code is deleted.
